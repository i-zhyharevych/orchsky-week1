// S3 Homework
// The company wants to host a static website using s3 and has 
// reached out to the DevOps team for assistance, they have done 
// most of the work themselves by providing the html files and
// the bucket policy that the security team wrote for them but
// there seems to be an issue with one of the files. 
// Troubleshoot and resolve the issue - demo your working solution 
// next class. You should be able to access the html index page
// from the bucket endpoint (endpoint url located at the properties 
// tab of your bucket - scroll through to find it)

1. I created S3 public bucket
2. Added provided client files to the bucket including bucket policy
3. After reviewing bucket policy file, I figured that there were a few 
mistakes in the bucketpolicypermissions.json file, so I generated new policy
according to the task using AWS policy generator.
policy needed updated Resource and Effect
4. I added new policy to the the bucket->permissions->bucket policy
5. Test it. index.html file is accessible through endpoint URL, error.html file is not,
because it wasn't part of the policy and didn't make it public using ACL
 

Note: other way to do this without using policy could be just add public access through ACL.
