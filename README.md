S3 Homework
The company wants to host a static website using s3 and has reached out to the DevOps team for assistance, they have done most of the work themselves by providing the html files and the bucket policy that the security team wrote for them but there seems to be an issue with one of the files. Troubleshoot and resolve the issue - demo your working solution next class. You should be able to access the html index page from the bucket endpoint (endpoint url located at the properties tab of your bucket - scroll through to find it)
